This was a task from our teacher to sort out pictures from messed up folder to a structure by year and then name the pictures by size. This was originally done in bash, thow i made it with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 
There are not tests as i don't have pictures that are tanken the same seconds and the code is first draft. Would be quite easy to set up once you have the pictures.
